My professional portfolio 

***rough draft of my dev portfolio - used the code from the run-buddy proj and tried to modify it as much as i could to throw together the bones.

also
 ***Used consistent themes throughout (DOOM) and tried to matched the colors of the boxes to match feel of the themes. this will make it easy to mix and match once ive decided what pics and projects to add/link
 *** links added - github, linkedin, and twitch profile (twitch is in the very bottom right)
